JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
Operator 	Description
+ 	Addition
- 	Subtraction
* 	Multiplication
** 	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/ 	Division
% 	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++ 	Increment
-- 	Decrement



JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.
Operator 	Example 	Same As
= 	x = y 	x = y
+= 	x += y 	x = x + y
-= 	x -= y 	x = x - y
*= 	x *= y 	x = x * y
/= 	x /= y 	x = x / y
%= 	x %= y 	x = x % y
**= 	x **= y 	x = x ** y
The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.


JavaScript Comparison Operators
Operator 	Description
== 	equal to
=== 	equal value and equal type
!= 	not equal
!== 	not equal value or not equal type
> 	greater than
< 	less than
>= 	greater than or equal to
<= 	less than or equal to
? 	ternary operator



Comparison operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.
JavaScript Logical Operators
Operator 	Description
&& 	logical and
|| 	logical or
! 	logical not



Logical operators are fully described in the JS Comparisons chapter.
JavaScript Type Operators
Operator 	Description
typeof 	Returns the type of a variable
instanceof 	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

Type operators are fully described in the JS Type Conversion chapter.
JavaScript Bitwise Operators

Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.
Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.
Operator 	Description 	Example 	Same as 	Result 	Decimal
& 	AND 	5 & 1 	0101 & 0001 	0001 	 1
| 	OR 	5 | 1 	0101 | 0001 	0101 	 5
~ 	NOT 	~ 5 	 ~0101 	1010 	 10
^ 	XOR 	5 ^ 1 	0101 ^ 0001 	0100 	 4
<< 	Zero fill left shift 	5 << 1 	0101 << 1 	1010 	 10
>> 	Signed right shift 	5 >> 1 	0101 >> 1 	0010 	  2
>>> 	Zero fill right shift 	5 >>> 1 	0101 >>> 1 	0010 	  2
